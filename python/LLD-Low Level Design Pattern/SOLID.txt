    --> there should be only one reason to change or modify the class

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    --> open for Extension but closed for Modification

    --> if class B is subtype of class A then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the
        behaviour of the program

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    --> interface should be such that, client should not implement unnecessary function they do not need

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
